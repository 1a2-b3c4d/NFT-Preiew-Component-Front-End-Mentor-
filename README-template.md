**My Process:**
In the process of creating this project, I followed these steps:

1. **HTML Structure**: I started by creating the HTML structure for the NFT preview card. This included defining the layout, adding images, text, and links.

2. **CSS Styling**: I applied CSS styling to the HTML elements to create the desired visual design. This involved setting colors, fonts, spacing, and adding hover effects for interactivity.

3. **Organization**: To maintain clean and organized code, I used comments to separate different sections of the CSS, such as variables, reset styles, global styles, and card-specific styles.

4. **Accessibility**: I ensured that all images had descriptive alt text to enhance accessibility for users who rely on screen readers.

**Built With:**
This project was built using HTML and CSS. HTML was used for structuring the content, while CSS was used for styling and layout. It also relied on external resources, such as Google Fonts and image assets, to enhance the design.

**What I Learned:**
Throughout this project, I reinforced my understanding of HTML and CSS for web development. Specifically, I learned and practiced the following:

1. Creating a structured HTML layout for a card component.
2. Using CSS variables to define and maintain a consistent color scheme.
3. Applying CSS styles for various elements, including text, images, and links.
4. Implementing hover effects to enhance user interactivity.
5. Ensuring accessibility by providing descriptive alt text for images.
6. Organizing code with comments for better readability and maintenance.

**Useful Resources:**
While working on this project, I found the following resources to be helpful:

1. **Google Fonts**: I used Google Fonts to import and apply the "Outfit" font to the project. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

2. **Image Assets**: I used image assets for the card's product image, icons, and the author's avatar. These resources were essential for visual elements.

3. **Online CSS Documentation**: I referred to online CSS documentation and references, such as the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) CSS documentation, for details on CSS properties and their usage. [MDN CSS Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

4. **Online HTML Documentation**: I used online HTML documentation for reference while structuring the HTML content. [MDN HTML Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

These resources were valuable for learning and troubleshooting during the project.
